UPDATE: This bug has been fixed in systemd-234.11-3 [testing]. Please use that
package instead.

This repository hosts the PKGBUILD for a patched copy of systemd - specifically,
the one found at https://github.com/andrewsoutar/systemd-stable. It contains a
patched which (hopefully) fixes systemd bug#6381, which breaks
systemd-cryptsetup under certain conditions. Unless you're testing or using this
patch, you do not need my package.

Building and installing the package is relatively straightforward. First, you'll
need the systemd tag-signing key:

$ gpg --recv-key 63CDA1E5D3FC22B998D20DD6327F26951A015CC4

Then, build and install the package:

$ makepkg -Csi

Don't forget to rebuild your initramfs if pacman didn't do it for you.

NOTE: If you try to build multiple times on the same source tree without
cleaning (the `-C` flag to makepkg), you WILL get errors.

This package is derived directly from the ABS systemd package
(https://git.archlinux.org/svntogit/packages.git, branch packages/systemd). I
have made only minor changes to the build scripts.
